                reps with before adding more. “It’s crazy how strong some people’s fingers can get,” he saysquarely in

            <h2>Next-Level Training developer</h2>
            <p>“Climbing, in general, does a pretty good job strengthening your lats, pecs and forearm muscles,”
                says
                Chi Harris, a Portland, Oregon-based coach. “But what gets overlooked are the antagonistic
                muscles—the
                ones that get used opposite your main climbing muscles.”

                If you only use one set of muscles in a really specific way, “you get pulled out of normalcy, so
                your
                body is out of equilibrium.” Powerfingers helps fix this. To counter all the grabbing you’re doing
                while
                climbing, these bands wrap around your fingers and spread them apart, so you’re forced to work the
                rest
                of the muscles in your forearms.</p>
